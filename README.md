# DevTalks2016

You'll fin here the source code of my demo at DevTalks Conference 2016. I used Genymotion as a simulator. To launch the app:

    git clone https://github.com/paulbrie/DevTalks2016.git
    cd DevTalks2016
    npm install
    react-native run-android
    
The point of this code snippet is to show how you can build a custom Android component that is accessible from the JavaScript thread.

The talk was called "Bridging with React-Native" and you can see the presentation here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Vs-uagvBoZiYx0efQyZ42U7KG9fHMYI6_fq--AtWsE/edit?usp=sharing
